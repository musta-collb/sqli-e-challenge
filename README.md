# sqli-e-challenge
Test driven challenge
This mini-project has as geal to master the technics of clean code and to respect the design pattern.
So the initail project has a test class for some functionalities the needs to be achieved.
The task was to Implement the project in such way to succesed the tests and respect some specific
clean code principale(Single responsibilty principle...) and also the disgn patterns such as
state design pattern.
Here is the general context of the project:
this test is about a building having several elevators with different states.
 *	For example, each elevator can be at a different level, and can he going up,
 *	or down.
 *	</P>
 *	The objective of this exercise is to write a program that will identify which
 *	elevator will be served once a request for an elevator is registered.
 *	</p,
 *	Please note these rules : â€¹/br>
 *	- An elevator is requested by default from the top:, floor.
 *	- An elevator can be resting at a given floor, going up or going down.
 *	- An elevator switch automatically his direction (reaching the edges of
 *	the building 
 *	- An elevator can not switch his direction in	of a building.
 *	- An elevator is never in between floors.
